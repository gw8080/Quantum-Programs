Transfer state faster than light

The transmission of information faster than light:
How to solve both A and B without transferring information when the two do not exist in the same place? By knowing the time evolution... If the wavefunction is measured repeatedly at A & B according to a ratio then if photons are blocked 100% then A & B are linked to the configuration of the ratio then the time evolution indicates the integer required for computation, without sending any classical information...
If the timescale for ratio based selection is more frequent than the quantized distance between A & B then information can travel faster than light.
