How to solve both A and B without transferring information when the two do not exist in the same place? By knowing the time evolution... If the wavefunction is measured repeatedly at A & B according to a ratio then if photons are blocked 100% then A & B are linked to the configuration of the ratio then the time evolution indicates the integer required for computation, without sending any classical information...

Prediction hypothesis:
to predict the next bit using the Novikov self consistency principle and projecting a harmonic oscillation of the wavefunction with a quantum program, the bit can be predicted by attaching a simple computation to sensing the self consistency/harmonics breaking, the wave function collapses, there should be a delay of the path integral according to a probabilistic parameters of the system being predicted, such as 50/50, by filtering the probability with obscure options it should be calcable which choice is the best way forward in predicting information.
