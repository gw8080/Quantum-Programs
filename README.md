How to solve both A and B without transferring information when the two do not exist in the same place? By knowing the time evolution... If the wavefunction is measured repeatedly at A & B according to a ratio then if photons are blocked 100% then A & B are linked to the configuration of the ratio then the time evolution indicates the integer required for computation, without sending any classical information...

Prediction hypothesis:
Sampling one qubit will have a probability distribution of the next qubit if arranged in series and where a parallel qubit has a coherence time that spans across those multiple qubit lifetimes, because those multiple qubits are linked sequentially there is finite time being processed instantly by the parallel qubit, creating temporal abnormalities.

This could require principles such as Novikov self consistency, harmonic oscillation and nested probabilistic parameters in order to work...

Quantum computer breakdown(should be right, subject to change):
Two 555 timers for partitioning, two counters to determine partition, two 8 bit dip switches for input data, four 2.5GHz optical detectors(four mirrors, four polarisers, four optical switches), two ATMEGA328P-PU's with a stored truth table(dip switch & instruction based program stepping/record) in EEPROM used to determine teleportation and corresponding logic gate result & LCD driver, two 16MHz Quartz Crystal Clocks, AVR ICSP Programming Adaptor, two LCD displays, finally the fiber optic storage ring, beam splitter & photon source (all can be miniaturised).
Note, to extend the QPU indefinitely with an additional qubit requires assigning EEPROM outputs to 'in series' flip-flop configuration running on synced partitioning, adding extra input data switches.
This expansion should be equivalent to finding the a sequence from a superpositioned set of bits in one instant. Furthermore, the computation process is reversible, therefore giving multiple probable answers with a degree of uncertainty. Programs and configurations can be adjusted to suit this paradigm...
