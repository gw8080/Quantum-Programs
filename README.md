How to solve both A and B without transferring information when the two do not exist in the same place? By knowing the time evolution... If the wavefunction is measured repeatedly at A & B according to a ratio then if photons are blocked 100% then A & B are linked to the configuration of the ratio then the time evolution indicates the integer required for computation, without sending any classical information...
