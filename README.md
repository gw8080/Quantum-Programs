How to solve both A and B without transferring information when the two do not exist in the same place? By knowing the time evolution... If the wavefunction is measured repeatedly at A & B according to a ratio then if photons are blocked 100% then A & B are linked to the configuration of the ratio then the time evolution indicates the integer required for computation, without sending any classical information...

Prediction hypothesis:
to predict the next bit using the Novikov self consistency principle and projecting a harmonic oscillation of the wavefunction with a quantum program, the bit can be predicted by attaching a simple computation to sensing the self consistency/harmonics breaking, the wave function collapses, there should be a delay of the path integral according to a probabilistic parameters of the system being predicted, such as 50/50, by filtering the probability with obscure options it should be calcable which choice is the best way forward in predicting information.

Quantum computer breakdown(should be right, subject to change):
Two 555 timers for partitioning, two counters to determine partition, two 8 bit dip switches for input data, four 2.5GHz optical detectors(four mirrors, four polarisers, four optical switches), two ATMEGA328P-PU's with a stored truth table(dip switch & instruction based program stepping/record) in EEPROM used to determine teleportation and corresponding logic gate result & LCD driver, two 16MHz Quartz Crystal Clocks, AVR ICSP Programming Adaptor, two LCD displays, finally the fiber optic storage ring, beam splitter & photon source (all can be miniaturised).
Note, to extend the QPU indefinitely with an additional qubit requires assigning EEPROM outputs to 'in series' flip-flop configuration running on synced partitioning, adding extra input data switches.
This expansion should be equivalent to finding the a sequence from a superpositioned set of bits in one instant. Furthermore, the computation process is reversible, therefore giving multiple probable answers with a degree of uncertainty. Programs and configurations can be adjusted to suit this paradigm...
